# Texas Hold'em Game Win Rate Simulator
A Java-based poker game simulation with ranking logic and testability.

Rules of the game will be based on explanation on Wikipedia.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_hold_%27em

The project is a Texas Hold'em poker game that evaluates hand rankings and calculates win probabilities.
This game automates the card dealing, community card revelation (flop, turn, river), and final showdown to determine the winner.
The goal is to provide players with a real-time evaluation of their hand strength and potential win rates at each game stage.


## Usage

The program begins by prompting for the number of players and creating Player objects.
A List<Player> holds all players.

1.	Games Setup:
It initializes a array list of Rank objects (RoyalFlush, StraightFlush, etc.) ordered from highest to lowest rank.
This list is used to determine hand rankings during the game.
User also need to enter the number of the players.

2.	Hand Card Setup and Deck Initialization:
User will asked to enter their hand cards and the community cards in the format of suit + rank,
e.g. sT -> ♠ Spade 10; cA -> ♣ Club Ace.

once user update these cards,
A Deck object will be created, representing the well shuffled deck without the cards we entered.
and then it will be ready to simulate.
this feature helps simulate each stage in real game.
(pre-flop, flop, turn, river)

3.	Simulation of games:
The winRate() function takes the current community cards and hand cards,
and estimates the player's chance of winning by simulating 50000 games.

it also provides winning counts of each rank.
This gives players an idea of their odds as the game progresses.
